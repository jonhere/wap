### Plus
* check for memleaks
* improve API
* make wap.js well minifiable (pick minifier)
* cargo features to customise wap.js (no debug / target window/worker/nodejs)
* optimize
* maybe support throw
* docs
* examples
* tests

### Maybies
* nodejs support
* Switch result to two u64. To simplify alignment. (maybe faster and potential future issue could break.)
* Consider changing raw string from null terminated.
